- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features but improve the structure.
- **perf**: Changes that improve performance.
- **test**: Adding or correcting tests.
- **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
- **ci**: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts.
- **chore**: Minor updates or administrative tasks that do not affect the codeâ€™s logic.
- **revert**: Reverts a previous commit.

### Scope

The optional **scope** can include the name of the file, folder, or specific module affected by the change. Examples:

- `security`: Updates in security modules.
- `examples`: Changes in the examples included in the project.
- `build`: Changes in the build system.

### Subject

The **subject** should be a brief description of what the commit does. Use the present tense, for example:
